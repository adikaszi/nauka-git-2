                    We're leaving together,
                    <br> But still it's farewell
                    <br> And maybe we'll come back
                    <br> To earth, who can tell?
                    <br> I guess there is no one to blame
                    <br> We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
                    <br> Will things ever be the same again?
                    <br> It's the final countdown
                    <br> The final countdown
                    <br>
                    <br> Oh
                    <br>
                    <br> We're heading for Venus (Venus)
                    <br> And still we stand tall
                    <br> Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)
                    <br> And welcome us all, yeah
                    <br> With so many light years to go
                    <br> And things to be found (to be found)
                    <br> I'm sure that we'll all miss her so
